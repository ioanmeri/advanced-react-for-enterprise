# Introduction to design systems

## What are design systems

A design system is an agreement that defines how a company or a set of people working together would build products. Engineers, designers and product managers use exactly the same components and collaborate together to create a system that could be **consistent across different platforms**.

That goes beyond e.g. buttons, can apply to the language that content creates use to create content (hard / soft tone of all blogs)

A set of agreed upon rules that a group of people can follow to develop products.

**Examples of core principles**

- Experience values
- Accessibility
- Internationalization
- Information architecture

all engineers, product managers have to respect when creating content / software products at the company.

**Some more**

- Color combinations
- Typography
- Illustrations
- Sounds
- Icons

The keyword here is **consistency**

## Atomic Design principles

A framework or a way of thinking about design systems.

The idea behind atomic design is breaking down the components or the parts of a design systems into 5 different parts:

- atoms
- molecules
- organisms
- templates
- pages

**Atoms**

An atom can exist on each own. Tiniest pieces of the system.

- input
- button

**Molecules**

Combination of atoms

**Organisms**

A combination of many molecules and atoms together

An organism is a larger structure, it can actually make sense to the user.

- nav bar
- blog post
- footer

**Templates**

A template is a combination of different organisms to actually make sense together.

- Login page
  - form
  - button
  - heading
  - card
  - checkbox
  - forgot your password link

**Page**

The only difference between templates and pages is the data used in it. The template has some fake data, but the page has real life data in it.
