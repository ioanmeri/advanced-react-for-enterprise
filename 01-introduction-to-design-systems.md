# Introduction to design systems

## What are design systems

A design system is an agreement that defines how a company or a set of people working together would build products. Engineers, designers and product managers use exactly the same components and collaborate together to create a system that could be **consistent across different platforms**.

That goes beyond e.g. buttons, can apply to the language that content creates use to create content (hard / soft tone of all blogs)

A set of agreed upon rules that a group of people can follow to develop products.

**Examples of core principles**

- Experience values
- Accessibility
- Internationalization
- Information architecture

all engineers, product managers have to respect when creating content / software products at the company.

**Some more**

- Color combinations
- Typography
- Illustrations
- Sounds
- Icons

The keyword here is **consistency**
